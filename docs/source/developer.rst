*vmt-plan* provides several modules for performing estate planning and analysis
within Turbonomic. The base module provides the plan engine :py:class:`~vmtplanner.Plan`, driven
by a :py:class:`~vmtplanner.PlanSpec`. The plans module provides pre-packaged plans for
specific use-cases, and the processors sub-package provides pre and post
processing analysis capabilities for advanced scenarios.
